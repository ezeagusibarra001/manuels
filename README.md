# Manuels

This website was created for a female presenter, with the aim that she can have the combination of a blog, an easy and simple way to sell her classes together with the visibility that a website of this style provides. We create the entire web from scratch using React JS for the front and Node JS + Mysql for the back. We also worked together with a designer who helped us with the design and templates.

I learned a lot during this project because I had the opportunity to face challenges like deploying an entire application on a server (Duplika for the front and Heroku for the back).
